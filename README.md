# pyboid
Boid's simulation in Pythonus using -5

## Usage
To run the simulation, you need:
- p5
- numpy (automatically installed alongside p5)
- vispy (automatically installed alongside p5)
- GLFW

While p5, numpy, and vispy are installed through pip, GLFW is a seperate installation not found in pip. 

See [here](https://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#prerequisites-glfw) for installation instructions.

## TODO
- Sliders
- Comments
- Refactoring
- Adding and removing boids (with sliders)
  - Other options
- Color???
